## Single Sign-On

The Hub's `google_auth_proxy` instance is configured as a single sign-on
service for multiple 18f.gov sub-domains using a single set of MyUSA OAuth
credentials. The configuration, inspired by the instructions in
[bitly/google_auth_proxy#12](https://github.com/bitly/google_auth_proxy/issues/12),
is subtle, but effective.

### MyUSA

The **Redirect uri** field in the Hub's MyUSA application settings is set to
`https://auth.18f.gov/oauth2/callback`. auth.18f.gov is defined in
`auth.conf`, described below.

### /usr/local/18f/etc/google_auth_proxy.cfg

These are the critical two lines:

```
redirect_url = "https://auth.18f.gov/oauth2/callback"
cookie_domain = ".18f.gov"
```

The `cookie_domain` ensures that a single `.18f.gov` auth cookie will provide
access to any application hosted on an 18f.gov sub-domain (for which the Hub's
`google_auth_proxy` is configured to act as a reverse proxy, of course).

### /etc/nginx/vhosts/auth-locations.conf

Include this file at the end of every Nginx `server` block for which you want the
`google_auth_proxy` to provide authentication. The `location /` block is the
normal case; after the user is authenticated, all requests will be routed
through this block and passed to the `google_auth_proxy`.

```
location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4180/;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
  proxy_connect_timeout 1;
  proxy_send_timeout 30;
  proxy_read_timeout 30;
}
```

The `location = /oauth2/start` block is almost identical, but performs part of
the magic hack that makes single sign-on work. It sets the `rd` (short for
"redirect") parameter of the `/oauth2/start` query string to the name of the
server in which this block is included.

For example, for hub.18f.gov, it will be `rd=%2Fhub.18f.gov`. `%2f` is the
hex-encoded version of the `/` character, so this is saying that once
authentication is complete, the `google_auth_proxy` should redirect back to
`/hub.18f.gov`. As we will see, the full URL of the redirect will be
`https://auth.18f.gov/hub.18f.gov`.

```
location = /oauth2/start {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4180/oauth2/start?rd=%2F$server_name;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
  proxy_connect_timeout 1;
  proxy_send_timeout 30;
  proxy_read_timeout 30;
}
```

### /etc/nginx/vhosts/auth.conf

This file defines the `auth.18f.gov` server. The `/oauth2/callback` block
forwards the request from the OAuth provider to the `google_auth_proxy`
running locally on port 4180:

```
  location = /oauth2/callback {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4180;
    proxy_connect_timeout 1;
    proxy_send_timeout 30;
    proxy_read_timeout 30;
  }
```

After the OAuth handshake succeeds, the `google_auth_proxy` will redirect back
to the `rd` URL generated by the `/oauth/start` block from above. The
following block parses the target host (e.g. hub.18f.gov) from the redirected
request and forwards the request to the target host. Using the earlier
example, `https://auth.18f.gov/hub.18f.gov` will be rewritten as
`https://hub.18f.gov`.

```
  location ~/(?<target_host>[^/]+)(?<remaining_uri>.*)$ {
    rewrite ^ $scheme://$target_host$remaining_uri;
  }
```

### *.conf files

Now, create a `/etc/nginx/vhosts/[YOUR-PROJECT].conf` file and include
the `auth-locations.conf` file in the bottom of the `server` block that
defines the https server:

```
  include vhosts/auth-locations.conf;
```
