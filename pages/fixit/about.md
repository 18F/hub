# Fixits

## What's a Fixit?

18F constantly evolves as people jump in to improve our culture and products. We also use sprints to introduce new features in a short period of time. A fixit is yet another way we can collectively rally within a scheduled period of time to get things done. A fixit is slightly different than a sprint:

* A fixit is more event-focused than a sprint.
* The goal of a fixit is broader: to get something to the next plateau rather than to implement specific feature sets.

## How Does a Fixit Work?

1. Someone identifies a process that could benefit from a concentrated effort (for example, on-boarding) and decides to organizer a fixit.
2. The fixit organizers compile a list of to-dos and assemble them in one place. These could be:
    * GitHub issues
    * Trello tasks
    * Surveys
2. At the appointed time, fixit participants collectively attack the to-do list, with individuals submitting a record of what they did. It's the organizers' job to make that last part easy.
3. After the appointed time, there will be thanks and recognition.
4. The organizers report on fixit outcomes and tweak the process for next time.

## Why?

The goal of a fixit isn't to clutter calendars that are already full. A fixit should:

* promote collaboration and ownership of 18F culture
* create a model for future 18F fixits
* provide a safe space for people to learn 18F tools

## Who Should Fixit?

Everyone at 18F can (and should!) contribute to a fixit. No special ops, code, or design skills necessary.
