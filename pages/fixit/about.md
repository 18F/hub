# Documentation Fixits

## What's a Fixit?

The 18F Hub constantly evolves as people jump in to make improvements. A fixit, on the other hand, is an organized event to take the Hub and its documentation to the next level.

Keep reading for the big picture. For more details:

* [Fixit participation guide](guides/participation)

## How Does a Fixit Work?

1. The documentation working group compiles a list of to-dos and assemble them in one place. These could be:
    * GitHub issues
    * Tasks from our Trello board
    * Surveys
2. At the appointed time, 18F collectively attacks the to-do list, with individuals submitting a record of what they did (don't worry, we'll make that last part easy).
3. After the appointed time, there will be thanks and recognition.
4. The documentation working group reports on fixit outcomes and tweaks the process for next time.
5. Repeat.

## Why?

The goal of a fixit isn't to put yet another thing on your calendar. By setting aside time to tackle documentation we hope to:

* ensure that all of us feel ownership of information on the Hub
* make the on-boarding process better for current staff and new hires
* create a model for doing other fixits at 18F
* provide a safe space for people to learn 18F tools like GitHub, Jeykll, and prose.io

## Who Should Fixit?

Everyone at 18F can contribute to a documentation fixit. No special ops, code, or design skills necessary.
