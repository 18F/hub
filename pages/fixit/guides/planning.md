# Planning a Fixit

Good planning will make people more likely to join the fixit, will ensure that fixit-ers have a smooth, productive experience, and will make it easier to document fixit outcomes.

## Fixit Planning Checklist

### Three Weeks Before Fixit
* Decide if the fixit will have a theme
* Set a date and invite people. Include a link to the [Fixit Overview](/fixit)

### Two Weeks Before Fixit
* Identify candidate fixit tasks
* Create a single place that people can use to find tasks during the Fixit
* Update the invite with a link to the task list

### One Week Before Fixit
* Make sure the [Fixit Participant Guide](/fixit/guides/participation) is current (or created)
