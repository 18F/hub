On April 17th, we've carved out some time to focus on fixing and creating 18F documentation related to onboarding.

1. Here's a list of things to work on:
    * [Hub issues](https://github.com/18F/hub/issues)
    * [18F Guide issues](https://github.com/18F/guides/issues)
    

2. After you complete a task, please log it here so we can report on what got done: [https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1lrA_ovE_LkNkqm1vXvk25jJeI5ETOuU0dKMRxZM63Ac/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1lrA_ovE_LkNkqm1vXvk25jJeI5ETOuU0dKMRxZM63Ac/edit#gid=0)
