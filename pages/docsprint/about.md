## What's a Doc Sprint?

18F constantly evolves as people jump in to improve our culture and products. We also use sprints to introduce new features in a short period of time. A _doc sprint_ is yet another way we can collectively rally within a scheduled period of time to get things done. A doc sprint is slightly different than what some of us normally think of as a sprint:

* A doc sprint is more event-focused than a sprint.
* The goal of a doc sprint is broader: to get something to the next plateau rather than to implement specific feature sets.

## How Does a Doc Sprint Work?

1. Someone identifies a process that could benefit from a concentrated effort (for example, on-boarding) and decides to organizer a doc sprint.
2. The doc sprint organizers compile a list of to-dos and assemble them in one place. These could be:
    * GitHub issues
    * Trello tasks
    * Surveys
3. At the appointed time, doc sprint participants collectively attack the to-do list, with individuals submitting a record of what they did. It's the organizers' job to make that last part easy.
4. After the appointed time, there will be thanks and recognition.
5. The organizers report on doc sprint outcomes and tweak the process for next time.

## Why?

The goal of a doc sprint isn't to clutter calendars that are already full. A doc sprint should:

* promote collaboration and ownership of 18F culture
* create a model for future 18F doc sprints
* provide a safe space for people to learn 18F tools

## Who Should Doc Sprint?

Everyone at 18F can (and should!) contribute to a doc sprint. No special ops, code, or design skills necessary.
