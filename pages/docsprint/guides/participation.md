# Doc Sprint Participation Guide

Taking our documentation to the next level is critical for scaling 18F. Here are some helpful materials and resources for participating in a doc sprint.

## You Will Need
To participate in an 18F doc sprint, you will need:

* A [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) with [two-factor authentication enabled](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/)

## Ways to Contribute
Each doc sprint will have a specific to-do list. You can participate by:

* Creating or updating documentation on the to-do list.
* Suggesting new documentation. The method for making a suggestion will depend on the project, but might be a GitHub issue or a Trello task.
* Giving feedback about documentation that others are creating during the doc sprint. This kind of conversation usually happens in a GitHub issue.
* Testing documentation created by others. For example, trying to stand up a local version of a project by following the directions in its README file.


## Tools

### Markdown

Most 18F documentation is written in Markdown, a text-to-HTML conversion tool. Markdown is pretty straightforward.

* Base [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* For documentation hosted on GitHub, note that [GitHub-flavored markdown is in effect](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). It's very similar to regular Markdown but has some slight differences as well as some extra features like syntax highlighting.

### Git and GitHub

A large amount of 18F documentation is managed via git repositories. These are hosted on GitHub, which makes it easier to edit the Markdown documents. GitHub also provides tools for opening and tracking issues and submitting changes (called _pull requests_).

If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, these resources can get you started. You definitely don't need to be a git power user, and you can always ask questions in the #git Slack channel.

* Edit GitHub documents online using prose.io (for projects that use it) [insert link to Mel's prose.io doc]
* [How to Use GitHub and the Terminal: A Guide](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/)
* [Mastering GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
