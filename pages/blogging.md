# Blog posts

We use milestones for workflow tracking:

1. `idea`
1. `draft`
1. `ready`
1. `approved`

For new posts:

1. Drop ideas for future blog posts into the `ideas` milestone as individual issues. Please include the following headings:
    * `## Audience`
    * `## Goal of blog post`
    * `## Imagery ideas`
    * `## Description` â€“ This is what people will see in the blog post list. If you'd like to create a separate description, insert it here; otherwise, we'll likely use the first couple of sentences of the post.
    * `## Who needs to clear the post` as a checklist (on your end, not GSA's), then come back and check them off when approved. Examples:
        * [ ] partner at agency
        * [ ] stakeholder
1. Any team member can "pick up" issues and begin drafting a post.
    * Once an issue is in writing mode, move it to the `drafts` milestone.
1. Create a Google Doc in [the Blog folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/#folders/0B-y3CqI2T1nndGE0c191NGtUTEU) with the text of your post.
    * Include the URL of the GitHub issue at the top.
    * Paste a link to the doc in the issue.
1. Once post is ready for comms approval:
    * Assign the issue to **@quepol** (Hillary).
    * Move it to the `ready` milestone.
1. Share the doc with:
    * Ori Hoffer
    * Gianelle Rivera (congressional)
    * Jackeline Stewart Johnson (press secretary)
1. After comments/suggestions are received from them, move the issue to the `approved` milestone.
1. Write a new comment and `/cc @gboone @OriHoffer`, who will:
    1. Help you follow the [blogging guide](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/blob/staging/blogging.md) to convert the post to Markdown, if you like
    1. Post it to staging
    1. Post it to production
1. Once post goes live, **close** the issue.
