## 18F Hub Data

There are two levels of data sources:

* [_data/private](https://github.com/18F/data-private): team, project, and
  snippet data stored in a private repo
* [_data](.): team, project, and snippet data stripped of private information,
  plus Hub-specific data

`_data/private` is not required to build the Hub. `_data` contains sample data
for people running their own Hub instance out-of-the-box as described in the
[top-level README](../README.md).

For more details, see [Internal vs. Public
Hubs](../_doc/internal-vs-public.md).
