bio: is a Presidential Innovation Fellow working on the MyUSA project at the General
  Services Administration. Hillary has been working to make government more accessible
  and available online for over 15 years, starting as a web designer for Arkansas.gov
  in 1997. In her most recent role as Director of Integrated Marketing for eGovernment
  provider NIC, Hillary helped NIC's 29 state portals embrace new technology and concepts
  for a 21st century government. She speaks at events across the country, educating
  and evangelizing “government 2.0” and social networking best practices for government.
  In 2004, Hillary led the team that created MyPollingPlace.com – the first-ever nationwide
  polling place lookup site launched during the 2004 November general election. Hillary
  spends much of her free time on community-based movements such as BarCamp and Coworking,
  and has participated in or helped organize several government-focused unconferences&#58;
  eDemocracyCamp, TranparencyCamp, Gov2.0Camp, CityCamp, etc. In 2008, after the passage
  of California’s Prop 8, she co-founded EqualityCamp – a pilot event bringing geeks
  who know the lessons of the web together with activists for marriage equality and
  LGBT equal rights. Her latest endeavor is Yes By Yes Yes (YxYY) a "geek retreat"
  taking place this summer in Palm Springs. The event sold out in 48 hours and will
  bring 400 thinkers, futurists, nerds, and creatives together at the Ace Hotel for
  the ultimate experiment in planned serendipity.
