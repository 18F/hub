bio: is a Presidential Innovation Fellow working on the MyUSA project at the General
  Services Administration. Previously, Justin was a Web Developer and Systems Administrator
  at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Institute of Engineering in Medicine.
  His interest in information systems started with extended bulletin board systems
  where he gained sponsorship from US Robotics (now 3Com) while in middle school.
  He studied biomedical science and specialized in the genetic engineering of plants
  for industrial and medicinal use at the University of Central Florida. He was drawn
  back to computer science after extensive genomic analysis of chloroplasts utilizing
  modern scripting languages, open-source software, and supercomputers. The joy of
  programming led him to a deep interest in web development and information security.
  At UCSD, he led a team that developed and open-sourced REUManager, an online application
  system that streamlines the application process for the NSF Research Experience
  for Undergraduates program. He is a vocal proponent of open-source software and
  actively creates new projects as well as contributing to existing ones. Originally
  from Minnesota, he now lives in San Diego, CA, with his wife Sri.
