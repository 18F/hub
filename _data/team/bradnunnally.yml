bio: |
  is a User Experience Designer based out of St. Louis, MO. For the last 9 years, he has been a ux consultant working with clients all over the country in just about every major industry. He started off focusing on user research and evaluations, but eventually shifted to focus more on interaction design. For the last couple of years, Brad’s been leading teams on key strategic projects that help set the tone for a year long engagement.
  Outside of work, Brad spends his time with his wife and two kids. Tristan (almost 6) and Payton (19 months) are two little creatures that keep things dynamic and interesting! The things that help him decompress and relax include photography, gaming, reading, comics, superheroes, and just about anything science related. Lately, he’s foolishly attempted to learn woodworking and thankfully he still has all of his hands and fingers. His wife Kim still gets a little scared everytime she hears the saw kick on though.
