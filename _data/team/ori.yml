bio: |-
  Ori is the communications manager for 18F. If you're doing a story on us, please contact me and I'll help get things coordinated.
  I've worked as a TV host, radio reporter, and online news producer.
  I play soccer, ski, and competed in skeleton. I also spent 10 years performing in improv comedy groups.
  Feel free to ask me about any of these things.
