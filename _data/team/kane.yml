bio: "Kane started in technology as a designer before the dot com era, but escaped by teaching herself C and several other programming languages. After working on database applications, she got curious about electric cars and went back to school at Berkeley for Mechanical Engineering. She was part of the engineering team that built a human powered vehicle that still holds the men's tandem record. After working for two years on CERN's ATLAS detector, she returned home to software.

As a technologist she provides engineering culture as a product, pairing with engineers to gather their user stories and escalating their issues up the chain. She works intermittently as a consultant and CTO taking on rescue project, struggling under their staggering technical (and product) debt. Kane was the director of a tech bootcamp after creating successful internship and mentorship programs. She has also hired and nurtured diverse, productive and happy engineering and product teams."
