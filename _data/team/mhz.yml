bio: was a Round 2 Presidential Innovation Fellow working on Open Data Initiatives
  at the Department of the Interior, and is now a UX Developer at 18F. In general,
  though, Michelle is a science communicator. From teaching ranchers to use satellite
  imagery to improve land management, to creating digital interfaces that facilitate
  access to weather data, she bridges the divide between data and understanding with
  structure, intelligence, and empathy. She has worked with clients ranging from small
  businesses to government agencies and international organizations, helping them
  strategize both offline and online user experiences to reach business and project
  goals. Before serving as a Fellow, she lent her user interface expertise to international
  data-sharing projects at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Satellite
  and Information Service. Her abilities include both front-end web development skills
  in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and user-centered design with strong opinions about
  typography and color. She has dual degrees in Environmental Policy and Mandarin.
