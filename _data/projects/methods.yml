project: Design Methods
name: methods
github:
- 18F/methods
description: A collection of design and research methods, including general descriptions
  and how-tos, to share how we work and build a common design vocabulary.
stage: beta
milestones:
- 'April 2015: Conducted one-on-one interviews with design leads across roughly 10
  projects.'
- 'May 2015: Built prototype sets of alpha method cards to get some quick feedback
  on our concept. Conducted a few more formal usability tests of the card decks, which
  led to some changes in the beta version.'
- 'June 2015: Ran randomized, controlled experiment to measure how method cards affected
  our 18F teammates’ knowledge and comfort with our design methods. People who received
  cards were slightly more knowledgeable and comfortable with methods than a control
  group whose members didn’t receive cards.'
- 'August 2015: Launched online, beta version of the methods at methods.18f.gov, including
  files and instructions for printed cards.'
