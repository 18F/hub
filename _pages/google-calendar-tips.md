## Working hours

About a third of the way down the "General" settings page there's a section called "*Working hours*" and a checkbox (bizarrely) unchecked by default. If you check it, you can specify the days and times that are your preferred working hours. Once you save your changes, other people will get a warning if they try and schedule you outside those times.

### Super awesome bonus setting!

A related feature in the Labs page is called "Hide morning and night" which will "minimize a range of hours in the morning and at night.

### Another super awesome bonus setting!

Another handy lab: Automatically declining events, will give you the option of "Busy (decline invitations)" in addition to "Available" and "Busy" under the "Show me as" section when creating events.

## Event duration

By default, Google Calendar thinks you want to schedule 30 minute meetings with people. But [some people](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/boone) can't sit still very long and prefer shorter meetings. [Other people](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/russ) _really like talking_ and prefer longer meetings. (Just kidding, Russ.)

If you are either of those people, this is the setting for you: *On the "General" settings screen look for a section called "Default event duration"* and click the dropdown to choose from either 15, 30, 60, 90, or (:scream:) 120 minutes.

### Super awesome bonus setting!

See that checkbox right below the dropdown? The one that says "Speedy meetings?" Check that box and 30 minutes becomes 25, 60 becomes 50, 90 becomes 80, and 120 becomes 110.

## Time zones

You can add an additional time zone. Helpful if you regularly have to schedule meetings with people who live on the other side of the country. It's limited to one, though, so if you have a multi-time zoned team it's only _so_ helpful.

*In the "Your current time zone:" section, click the "Show an additional time zone" link.*

### Super awesome bonus setting!

There's a "world clock" feature under "labs" which doesn't integrate as well with the calendar but _does_ show the current time in multiple timezones.

## Adding video calls

When you create an event, under the "Where" input there's a link for "Add video call." Click this to add a Google Hangout to the meeting. Helpful if you don't expect your colleagues across the country to come to DC for your meeting!

### Super awesome bonus setting!

The "Add video call" link automatically gives the call a name like gregory-boone. But that's a dumb name for a video call. Click the "change name" link below the new "Join meeting" link and you can set it to whatever you want!
