## Do these things immediately!

* Please read the [18F code of conduct](https://handbook.18f.gov/code-of-conduct).{% unless site.public %}

* [Work remotely? Start here](../private/remote-employee-faq). If you don't work in DC, please make sure you start here for tips from other 18F employees.{% endunless %}

* Reset your [Mac password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860) and [ENT password](http://reset.gsa.gov).{% unless site.public %}

* [Set up two-factor authentication](../private/two-factor/) for email, GitHub, and Slack.{% endunless %}

* [Set up Slack](../slack/). You'll have questions about the steps below, and you'll need to ask for help.  _(Hint: There's a [#questions channel](https://18f.slack.com/messages/questions/).)_

* [Get GitHub configured properly for work]({{ site.baseurl }}/github-work/). Even if you aren't a developer, many discussions happen on GitHub, and it's required to add or update Hub pages.

* [Secure your MacBook]({{ site.baseurl }}/macbook-security/).

* Get familiar with [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6021313?hl=en) and the [18F Team folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/folderview?id=0B84F26FpUP0lR1B2VVNGSi1MMVk&usp=sharing_eid)
    * The folder structure may be unintuitive; make sure to bookmark folders you want to browse regularly, otherwise use search instead.
    * Searching in Drive goes through all the files that have been shared with you.
    * Highlight a file, then hit Shift-Z to quickly add files or folders to "My Drive" for fast access.
    * Grant "edit" or "comment" access to the entire team on a files by adding [18f-team@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-team@gsa.gov) in the Share menu. Consider disabling the notification email if you don’t wish to bring it to the team’s attention right away.
    * You can also create and share whole folders; new files in a folder auto-inherit the sharing settings.

* [Run the `laptop` script](https://github.com/18F/laptop) to configure your 18F laptop with everything you need to be productive.
    * Read [Greg and Mel's blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/) on how to use GitHub, which will walk you through the script.

* [Get your badge]({{ site.baseurl }}/badge/).{% unless site.public %}

* [Set up VPN and remote network access](../private/access-gsa-remote/). [this may be failing currently on Macs]{% endunless %}

* Make a calendar reminder to badger for access to On-line University (OLU), GSA's mandatory training courses.
    * You won't have OLU access until you are set up in CHRIS. You will receive
      an email within a few weeks of starting notifying you that your CHRIS
      profile is ready.
    * Once you have CHRIS access, you can request an OLU password via [live chat](
      https://clientsupport.eskillz.com/Interface/Chat.aspx).
    * Once you have OLU access, training is mandatory or you lose computer
      privileges. More information about OLU training is available on the
      [OLU page]({{ site.baseurl }}/olu/).

* If you are in the SF office, change the order of your wireless networks so that gsa-wireless is higher priority than GSA-Guest (otherwise you will be shunted to the latter silently and lose time troubleshooting as a result).
