# {{ page.title }}

Welcome to 18F! We are so glad you are here.

We are in the process of redoing this page to make it more streamlined for new employees. If you want to see a preview of the new page, [please click here to see the Newcomer's Guide to 18F](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rv8_QSEkHzS6Rc-A39_v2kH48ZFHjyXoeAVTTmBkpwk/edit#heading=h.y0rk4ydz384i) - eventually this page will be replaced by the Newcomer's Guide, which organizes information by day and week. 


## Do these things immediately!

* Please read the [18F code of conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

* [Work remotely? Start here.](../private/remote-employee-faq) If you don't work in DC, please make sure you start here for tips from other 18F employees.

* [Set up two-factor authentication](../private/two-factor/) for email, Github, and Slack.

* [Set up Slack.](../slack/) You'll have questions about the steps below, and you'll need to ask for help.  _(Hint: There's a [#questions channel](https://18f.slack.com/messages/questions/).)_

* [Get GitHub configured properly for work.]({{ site.baseurl }}/github-work/) Even if you aren't a developer, many discussions happen on GitHub, and it's required to add or update Hub pages.

* [Secure your MacBook.]({{ site.baseurl }}/macbook-security/)

* Get familiar with [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6021313?hl=en) and the [18F Team folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/folderview?id=0B84F26FpUP0lR1B2VVNGSi1MMVk&usp=sharing_eid)
    * The folder structure may be unintuitive; make sure to bookmark folders you want to browse regularly, otherwise use search instead.
    * Searching in Drive goes through all the files that have been shared with you.
    * Highlight a file, then hit Shift-Z to quickly add files or folders to "My Drive" for fast access.
    * Grant "edit" or "comment" access to the entire team on a files by adding [18f-team@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-team@gsa.gov) in the Share menu. Consider disabling the notification email if you don’t wish to bring it to the team’s attention right away.
    * You can also create and share whole folders; new files in a folder auto-inherit the sharing settings.

* [Run the `laptop` script](https://github.com/18F/laptop) to configure your 18F laptop with everything you need to be productive.
    * Read [Greg and Mel's blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/) on how to use GitHub, which will walk you through the script.

* [Get your badge.]({{ site.baseurl }}/badge/)

* [Set up VPN and remote network access.](../private/access-gsa-remote/) [this may be failing currently on Macs]

* Make a calendar reminder to badger for access to On-line University (OLU), GSA's mandatory training courses.
    * You won't have OLU access until you are set up in CHRIS. You will receive
      an email within a few weeks of starting notifying you that your CHRIS
      profile is ready.
    * Once you have CHRIS access, you can request an OLU password via [live chat](
      https://clientsupport.eskillz.com/Interface/Chat.aspx).
    * Once you have OLU access, training is mandatory or you lose computer
      privileges. More information about OLU training is available on the
      [OLU page]({{ site.baseurl }}/olu/).

* If you are in the SF office, change the order of your wireless networks so that gsa-wireless is higher priority than GSA-Guest (otherwise you will be shunted to the latter silently and lose time troubleshooting as a result).

## Check out the team-specific onboarding pages

...if they apply to you.

* Read the [18F open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) (especially if you're not a developer!) and the [team process FAQ.](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md).

## Someone else should have taken care of these
Speak up if you haven't been added to [the 18F mailing lists](../private/listservs/#18f-specific) the appropriate lists and the 18F team calendars below. Team calendars are stored in the left hand menu of Google Calendar, where you can toggle them on or off.

* 18F Events and 18F Out of Office
* Check if the Guild or Working Group you're in has a calendar (they will need to add you first).
