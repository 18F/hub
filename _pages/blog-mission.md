title: Blog Mission Brief
---
## Mission

The 18F blog is a place where we share what we’ve learned, what we’ve made, and what we do in an accessible, public way. We work in the open and share information that makes our work understandable and usable. We write frankly about the challenges we encounter and detail the lessons we learn when making tough decisions. Our blog sheds light on the innovation, integrity, and creativity of our teams and other teams across the government. We hope to lead by example, showing that government agencies can be straightforward and friendly in their communication.  

Additionally, our blog is a platform for highlighting the diversity and humanity of our team. We are a thoughtful, civic-minded group, and we acknowledge the value of underscoring that to our readers. Both our business and recruitment benefit when we post personal stories and profiles, which engender warmth and connection between 18F and the larger community.

In sum, our goals are:
* To support and highlight the operational excellence our employees’ daily work provides to GSA, the federal government, and the public
* To strengthen our partnership with other federal agencies
* To strengthen our relationship with the public and people who might want to join 18F
* To actively promote innovation in government, wherever it’s happening

## Execution

Our publications adhere to 18F’s Content Guide, actively promoting both a unified style and a multitude of voices. The communications team determines editorial strategy; that team also oversees the drafting and editing process.
The blog is further supported by volunteer writers across 18F. Team contributions (idea generation, drafting, giving interviews) are key to its success. We accept pitches for blog ideas from everyone on the 18F team in a working GitHub repository. We also cover events that involve team members.

## Risks and concerns

We assess every post to ensure it adheres to our mission, as outlined above. This might mean a blog post aligns with GSA’s vision and goals. It might also mean a post is one of human-interest. Being this open about all aspects of our work is atypical for a government agency, and, as such, we expect to encounter occasional resistance. We acknowledge the need to show strategy and data that supports our ambition.

## Conclusion

Part of GSA’s mission is to “deliver the best value in… technology services to government and the American people.” By showcasing the value 18F provides to users, this blog is a vital part of GSA’s communications platforms.
