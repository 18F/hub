**UPDATE:  This appears to no longer be necessary as GSA IT finally turned off mrec.gsa.gov.**


## There’s an additional spam filter on by default. Kill it.
* Visit [http://mrec.gsa.gov](http://mrec.gsa.gov).
* Click "My Settings" on the top right.
* Click "Manage Junk Filters."
* Click "ACTIVATED," and watch it change to “DEACTIVATED.”
