TeamOps is testing Communicart for requesting computer hardware, software, and licenses â€“ make new requests here:

https://cap.18f.gov/gsa18f/procurements/new

If you're requesting software, be sure you have permission from #devops first. If it's software that runs directly on your laptop, speak with @kimber first. TeamOps will not approve software without DevOps clearance. 

Drop by #cap if you have trouble accessing, or ask any questions about the procurement process in #teamops.
