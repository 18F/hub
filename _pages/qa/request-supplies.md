TeamOps is testing [Communicart](cap.18f.gov) for requesting office supplies, computer hardware, approved software, trainings, and other items under $3,500. 

When you open Communicart at [cap.gsa.gov](cap.gsa.gov), you'll want to first "Sign in with MyUSA". Connect with Google first, then scroll down and click "Allow" on the next screen. Once logged in, you should see a button "New 18F request". This is where you can create and submit your equipment request.

If you don't see this link, it's possible that you haven't been set up as a member of 18F yet. If that's the case, shoot an email to capdevs@gsa.gov and one of the developers will help you get access.

If you're requesting software that no one else at 18F uses yet, be sure you have permission from [#devops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/devops) first. If it's software that runs directly on your laptop, speak with [Kimber Dowsett](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@kimber first). TeamOps will not approve software without DevOps clearance.

If you'd like to check out Apple peripherals (i.e. Magic mouse, keyboard, etc., make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform).

Drop by [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment) if you have trouble accessing, or ask any questions about the request process in [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/teamops).
