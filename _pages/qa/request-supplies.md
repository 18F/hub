TeamOps is in the process of moving back to using Communicart. Help test some of the new features by making your request via Communicart at [cap.18f.gov](cap.18f.gov)!

Communicart uses MyUSA-- "connect with Google" first, then scroll down and click "Allow" on the next screen. Once logged in, you should see a button "New 18F request". This is where you can create and submit your equipment request.

If you don't see this link, it's possible that you haven't been set up as a member of 18F yet. If that's the case, shoot an email to capdevs@gsa.gov and one of the developers will help you get access.

If you're requesting software that no one else at 18F uses yet, be sure you have permission from #devops first. If it's software that runs directly on your laptop, speak with @kimber first. TeamOps will not approve software without DevOps clearance. 

If you'd like to check out Apple peripherals (i.e. Magic mouse, keyboard, etc., make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform)

Drop by #equipment if you have trouble accessing, or ask any questions about the procurement process in #teamops.
