TeamOps is temporarly using a Google request form for requesting computer hardware, software, and licenses â€“ make new requests here:

https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1zSuFinxBVr0_oi2aGFaHArRJ8McyfQhjC05SOG_uCzo/viewform

If you're requesting software, be sure you have permission from #devops first. If it's software that runs directly on your laptop, speak with @kimber first. TeamOps will not approve software without DevOps clearance. 

Drop by #teamops if you have trouble accessing, or ask any questions about the procurement process in #teamops.
