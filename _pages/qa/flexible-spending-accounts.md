## What is a Flexible Spending Account?

With Flexible Spending Accounts you can:

* Pay for eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars
* NOT pay for any type of premiums

You must use all the money in your account, by the end of the year or you risk forfeiture of the unused funds.

There is a grace period. If you have unused funds in your FSA account and incur expenses from January 1 through March 15, you have until April 30 to submit claims against your prior year account.


## How do I enroll in a Flexible Spending Account?

* You have **60 days** to enroll from the date of your appointment
* If you do not enroll within 60 days, you must wait until the next Open Season to enroll
* You must re-enroll each Open Season, which is in late November and early December
* You can [enroll on the FSA Feds website](https://www.fsafeds.com/GEM)
