## What is a Flexible Spending Account?

With Flexible Spending Accounts you can:

* Pay for [eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses](http://dtg.adp.com/FSAFEDSExpenseViewer#/search) with pre-tax dollars
* NOT pay for any type of premiums

You must use all the money in your account by the end of the year, or you risk forfeiture of the unused funds. There is a grace period. If you have unused funds in your FSA account and incur expenses from January 1 through March 15, you have until April 30 to submit claims against the prior year.

## How do I enroll in a Flexible Spending Account?

* You have **60 days** from the date of your appointment to enroll on the [FSA Feds website](https://www.fsafeds.com/GEM), **but:**
* To be eligible for the current calendar year, you must enroll **before October 1**
* If you miss the deadline, you must wait until the next Open Season in November or December
* You must re-enroll each Open Season
