An employee is entitled to taking FMLA when they have been an employee of the federal government for at least 12 months. Note: An employee who has transferred from another agency can use their time to count for 12-month restriction.

The Department of Labor has a [detailed guide to the FMLA](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/) to FMLA, including this [FMLA FAQ](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/fmla-faqs.htm) which goes into extensive detail.
