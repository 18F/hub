## If I'm logged into the GSA email account, what web browser activity on our personal computer is being tracked?

Unless you have a VPN connection to a federal network, none of your web browsing is being tracked from your personal computer. We can see what outbound links you click on from your GSA email, but that's it.

While on a GSA or federal network, including wireless, 100 percent of your browsing is tracked.
