## Change your home address 

Changing your home address on [Employee Express](http://www.employeeexpress.gov) will notify most GSA operations of your new address.  

To notify the Thrift Savings Program of your new address, email it to both the Consolidated Processing Center at cpc.personnel@gsa.gov and to the GSA payroll office at KC-Payroll.Finance@gsa.gov.  Payroll will notify the TSP office of your new address.
