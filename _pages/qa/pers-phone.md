## Can I use my personal phone to access Federal email, such as logging into my GSA email through the Gmail app on my personal phone? 

Sure. You should be redirected to the ENT password screen. But note that the [GSA IT ServiceDesk](https://gsa.service-now.com/navpage.do) does not support this connection, so please *do not* bother them as they will reject your request.
