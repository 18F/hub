The Hatch Act limits certain political activities of federal employees, as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs.

## What is the purpose of the Hatch Act?

​The law’s purposes are to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation.​

## What do I need to know about the Hatch Act and activity on social media?

The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) maintains a [plethora of resources](http://www.oge.gov/Topics/Outside-Employment-and-Activities/Political-Activities/) on the Hatch Act, including a FAQ of questions [regarding social media and the Hatch Act](https://osc.gov/Resources/Social%20Media%20and%20the%20Hatch%20Act%202012.pdf) and DigitalGov has [a YouTube video that outlines the do's and don'ts of the Hatch Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVSOmrLMrjU&app=desktop).

## Is there a summary of what I can and can't do as a federal employee?

Yes. OSC also has [a handy chart](https://osc.gov/Resources/HA%20Poster%20-%20The%20Hatch%20Act%20and%20Federal%20Employee.pdf) that summarizes what federal employees can and can't do.
