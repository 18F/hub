## Add yourself to our contact info, hub, and home page

* Add your contact info to the [team contact list](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Auy3CqI2T1nndGd3U3h3ZkVXQVhvVkhBcDhZWTRIblE&usp=drive_web#gid=3).
* [https://hub.18f.gov (The Hub)](https://hub.18f.gov) is our internal team, project, and documentation directory. If you're not reading this on the Hub and you can't access it, send [Mike Bland](mailto:michael.bland@gsa.gov)) your [gsa.gov](http://gsa.gov/) email address (when you have it). He'll add you to the access list.
* Once you have access to the 18F GitHub team, add your info to [the `team` directory of the `data-private` repository](https://github.com/18F/data-private/tree/master/team). There will already be a `yml` file there with your basic info (this is what gave you access to Hub in the first place), but add your skills and interests. The `yml` file serves several purposes:

    * Populates profile on the Hub that allows cross-linking across projects, working groups, guilds, locations, skills, and interests, as well as [snippets](https://hub.18f.gov/snippets/).
    * Provides info for the [Team API](https://team-api.18f.gov/api/) that also does all this cross-linking
