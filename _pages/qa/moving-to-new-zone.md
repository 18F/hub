You work at 18F. You're moving to a different part of the country. Here's what you have to know:


### Notification and Paperwork


After receiving approval from your direct supervisor please email your new address and move effective date to **Cristina Brydges (@Cristina)** or **Shawnique Muller (@Shawnique)** copying your supervisor.  Ideally 30 days in advance of your move.  

**Please note** your effective date should be the start of a pay period.  Pay period dates can be found on GSA InSite [here](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/500083). 

Cristina and/or Shawnique will complete a report of personnel action (RPA) and a virtual worker agreement (VWA) which is used if you're not going to work out of a federal office along with a VWA Appendix 2.  The paperwork is submitted to OHRM and then they process everything.  You will only need to sign the Appendix 2.


### Your pay will change

Look up your new pay [here](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2015/general-schedule/). Find your area and then your step/grade. That's what you'll be paid in your new location.


### Change your address

Changing your home address on Employee Express will notify most GSA operations of your new address.

To notify the Thrift Savings Program (TSP) of your new address, email it to both the Consolidated Processing Center at cpc.personnel@gsa.gov and to the GSA Payroll office at KC-Payroll.Finance@gsa.gov. Payroll will notify the TSP office of your new address.

Don't forget to contact your health insurance, dental insurance, and any other insurances you may have and let them know about your address change. 

### Change your Slack location

We've started putting our location in parentheses after our names in Slack, to make it easier for coworkers to tell where we are. To change this, go [here](https://18f.slack.com/account/profile), click on profile, and change the letters after your last name.
