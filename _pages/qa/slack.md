Getting on Slack: [https://18f.slack.com/](https://18f.slack.com/). You will probably want to download the Slack desktop client from the App Store.

* Remember to first review [18F's Slack standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/slack). These are the required steps you need to take first.
* You'll automatically be added to several channels. The most important is #news, as it contains announcements from the 18F management team. Browse through the available channels. You may want to take a look at:
    * #questions (a friendly place to ask questions)
    * #it-issues (IT related questions)
    * #random (idle chatter!)
    * #friends (allies of 18F, both inside and outside of government)
    * Location based channels:
        * #dc
        * #dc-lunchbell
        * #sf
        * #chitown
        * #nyc
    * Your team
        * #dev
        * #design
        * #devops
        * #teamops
        * #product
