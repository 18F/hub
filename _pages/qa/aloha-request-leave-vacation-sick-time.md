[ALOHA](http://aloha.gsa.gov/) is the website we use to request and document sick or annual leave.

## How early should I request time off?

The best practice is to ask for leave ahead of time. However, it's possible to request leave retroactively, if necessary.

## How do I request time off?

1. Visit [ALOHA](http://aloha.gsa.gov/) and use your GSA credentials to log in.
2. Submit your supervisor approval to Aaron Snow.
3. Add an event to the Google calendar "18F Out of Office," so everyone knows you're out of the office.

## How do I access ALOHA if I'm a remote employee?

You need to be on the GSA network to access ALOHA. Follow the directions [here](https://hub.18f.gov/private/access-gsa-remote/) and then request time off, as described above.

## How do I see my remaining leave balance?

See your remaining leave balances by clicking "Create My Leave Request." You do not have to submit a request. You can also see your leave balance on your paystub in Employee Express.

## Should I use ALOHA if I have jury duty?

No. Send a message to Leah Gitter with the dates you'll be out and add an event to the Google calendar "18F Out of Office," so everyone knows you're out of the office.
