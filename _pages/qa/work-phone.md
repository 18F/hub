# {{ page.title }}

If you're new to 18F, Shawnique will have already submitted a request to IT for a work phone on your behalf. You should receive a confirmation email within a few weeks letting you know that the phone is ready to be picked up. 

The default phone now is an iPhone 6, but if you prefer a Samsung Galaxy S5, reach out to Kathryn Connolly. Kathryn will also be able to confirm if your phone request is in process. 

If you are remote, or work in an office besides D.C., once you receive the email alerting you that the phone is ready to be picked up, reach out the Kathryn, and she can follow up with the IT folks so that the phone can be mailed to you. 

# Troubleshooting

If you get your work iPhone, and you find you can't send email with it, create a new email and check the "From" field. If it's a jumble of letters and numbers @secure.mass360.com, tap on it to change it to the @gsa.gov email address. Then go `Settings-->Mail-->Default Account->GSA Account` to switch the default.
