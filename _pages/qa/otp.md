* **Via the web:** If you're using [gsa-apps.gsa.gov](https://gsa-apps.gsa.gov/), youâ€™ll need a one-time password (OTP) to authenticate. This is in addition to your ENT username and password. Get that OTP anytime, from anywhere, at [https://otp.gsa.gov](https://otp.gsa.gov). Remember to set up your email as detailed [here](../../private/two-factor/) so you'll have access to the OTP.

* **Via an app:** Install OTP app on desktop or mobile from [insite.gsa.gov/myview](http://insite.gsa.gov/myview) in row labeled "Log In while off the GSA network"
