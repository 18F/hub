title: How do I register for classes at On-Line University (OLU)?

# {{ page.title }}

[On-Line University](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) contains GSA's mandatory training courses.

## How do I register for classes?

In order to register for OLU, you need to have an account in CHRIS (the GSA website that lets you access your personnel files.) It can take several weeks to receive a CHRIS account.

You should receive an email when your CHRIS account is activated. If you do not receive this email within a month of starting at 18F, you can try opening a ticket with [the GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/)

  * Your access to CHRIS is contingent on fully clearing security; your security upon starting may only be provisional, which is the reason for the delay.

Once you have access to CHRIS, OLU will send an email notification when you're approved for access.


## How long does this process take?


It takes roughly 4 – 6 weeks to create an OLU account. The countdown starts after you are entered into CHRIS, which can take 3 – 4 weeks, then it is an additional 2 – 3 weeks for an OLU account to be created.

If you haven’t received an OLU email after two months  on the job and you already have a CHRIS account, following the "need help logging in" link on the OLU main page and then requesting OLU access via live chat.

## What courses do I need to take?

  * Mandatory courses include:
      * IT Security Awareness and Privacy 101: Failure to complete this course can lead to GSA cutting off your email access.
      * No FEAR Act: Use **Firefox** or **Safari with IE8 User Agent**, or it won't register that you completed the course. Upon completion of the test, you might not be able to click on the **Exit** button as is suggested. Try closing the window that the test was in and clicking next on the parent window - this should register your test as having been completed and generate the certification that is loaded to your profile.
      * Telework Works: After completing this training, submit a telework agreement using the steps are outlined below:
          * Select Aaron Snow as your supervisor.
          * Select "Citizens Services and Innovative Technologies (X) Telework" in question 13.
          * Don't worry about not being able to type in any of the text fields. The form will submit just fine even if the mandatory phone number field is blank.
      * Annual Ethics Training
  * Concur online training: You cannot travel without taking this. See [To Book Travel](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1Ozxnz2mLh0UPxMYgOEnHmabg1xbMeynWjYWxgWutHkE/) for more information.

## I took my training and CHRIS doesn’t recognize this, what happened?

It takes CHRIS 4 days to reflect OLU certifications.

## What browser should I use?

Note: OLU sometimes says you must use IE, but Chrome and Firefox work just fine.
