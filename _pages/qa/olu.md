## Register for [On-Line University](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) (OLU): GSA's mandatory training courses
  * OLU will send an email notification when you're approved for access. If you're a new employee or contractor, it normally takes two to three weeks to have your user profile come through from CHRIS to the GSA OLU. In some cases, this can take up to seven weeks. You should get a welcome email directly from the OLU once your account has been created. Note: OLU sometimes says you must use IE, but Chrome and Firefox work just fine.
  * If you havenâ€™t received an OLU email after three weeks on the job and you already have a CHRIS account, following the "need help logging in" link and then requesting OLU access via live chat.
  * If you don't have a CHRIS account (you'll get an email when yours is activated) after about three weeks, you can try opening a ticket with [the GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/)
  * Note that your access to CHRIS is contigent on fully clearing security; your security upon starting may only be provisional.
  * Mandatory courses include:
      * IT Security Awareness and Privacy 101: Failure to complete this course can lead to GSA cutting off your email access.
      * No FEAR Act: Use Firefox or Safari with IE8 User Agent, or it won't register that you completed the course.
      * Telework Works: After completing this training, submit a telework agreement using the steps are outlined below: 
          * Select Aaron Snow as your supervisor.
          * Select "Citizens Services and Innovative Technologies (X) Telework" in question 13.
          * Don't worry about not being able to type in any of the text fields. The form will submit just fine even if the mandatory phone number field is blank.
      * Annual Ethics Training
  * Concur online training: You cannot travel without taking this. See [To Book Travel](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1Ozxnz2mLh0UPxMYgOEnHmabg1xbMeynWjYWxgWutHkE/) for more information.
