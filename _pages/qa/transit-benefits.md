All GSA employees are eligible for transit subsidies which cover the cost of your public transportation travel.

**DC**

To receive a transit subsidy, for MARC, VRE, and Commuter Buses, fill out [GSA form 3675](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115174). The form asks for your supervisor’s signature. Note for Metro you need [GSA form 3675A](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/117198) (it will have a “SmarTrip Card Serial Number” field in the upper right). You must already have a SmarTrip card and [have registered it on the Metro website](https://smartrip.wmata.com/Account/Create). It should be a distinct card from what you use for personal travel.

DC employees should send the completed form, once you have the appropriate supervisor signature, to Karen Lomax at karen.lomax@gsa.gov for processing. It could take a while to get it to start being on your card, so do this ASAP if you want to benefit for a full month.
