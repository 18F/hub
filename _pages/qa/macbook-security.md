* You should [require password immediately](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18669?viewlocale=en_US) when your computer sleeps or shows screensaver.
* Lock your computer before leaving it. The command for this is `control + shift + power button` for newer MacBooks and `control + shift + eject` for older MacBooks with optical drives. If you use Alfred, you can open Alfred and just type ``lock``.
* [Encrypt your hard drive](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790) with FileVault.
