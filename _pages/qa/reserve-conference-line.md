# {{ page.title }}

Get a conference line by  requesting an online meeting room via GSA's Meeting Space.  
**Pro-tip:** Your conference number never dies! Keep the same one forever! Also, you can share the "moderator" code with everyone so people don't have to wait to get on the line. You can send an email whenever the line is used with the numbers that dialed in.

Reserving your own conference line can take up to eight days.

If you've never used Meeting Space:

1.  Log into [https://meet.gsa.gov](https://meet.gsa.gov).
2.  Click "Meetings" from the top menu, and then click "New Meeting."
3.  Fill out the required fields on the "Meeting Information" form and accept the defaults for everything else. Essentially, you're setting up a fake meeting to trigger a request for a conference line.
4.  After you set up the meeting, an "audio profile" is automatically generated for you. This profile is what has the information about your conference line. The profiles are created in weekly batches, so it can take up to seven or eight days before yours is created.
3.  Once your audio profile is created — you won't receive an e-mail notification — log back into [https://meet.gsa.gov](https://meet.gsa.gov).
4.  Click "Meetings" from the top menu, and then click "New Meeting."
5.  On the "Enter Meeting Information" page, scroll down to "Audio Conference Settings" and click "Manage Audio Profiles."
6. You should see a table on the left-hand side of the screen that lists an audio profile (with a name something like "GSA Meeting Space Audio Profile"). If the table is empty, your profile hasn't been created yet.
7. Click the audio profile name to see your conference line number and passcodes.
