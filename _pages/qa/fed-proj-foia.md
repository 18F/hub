## Is a project I'm doing for the federal government FOIA-able if parts of it are on my personal computer?

It depends. If that is both the canonical and *only* source of that information, yes. If it is being mirrored to a federal run git server, GitHub, or any other service (like a server in AWS), no. This also applies to non-code assets.
