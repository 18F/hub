* There are lot of awesome [keyboard shortcuts](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201374536-Keyboard-Shortcuts). Like:
    * `Option+Up` or `Option+Down` is a quick-switch between channels and direct messages. Use `Cmd +` to go through your channel history.
    * `Esc` marks all messages in the current channel as read.
    * `Shift-Esc` marks **all** messages across **all** channels as read. Only do this if youâ€™ve caught up in channels for your projects first.
    * `Shift+Option` or `Alt+Up/Down` cycles through channels with unread messages.
* [Here are some formatting tricks](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-How-can-I-add-formatting-to-my-messages-)
* There are some really useful settings in:
    * The advanced settings section
        * One favorite is only showing channels that have unread messages.
    * [Turn on desktop notifications for particular channels only](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201649323-Overriding-default-notification-preferences-for-a-channel-or-group).
* You can see all of the links posted in a particular Slack channel by clicking on [this link](https://18f.slack.com/archives/design/links) and replacing "design" with the name of any Slack channel.
* Click on the timestamp on any Slack post to go to the archival view of that post. This is helpful if you'd like to post the link to another channel.
* When using Slack on mobile, you can mention someone in a channel they aren't in and they *won't* get a notification. You only get the "invite them" options when on desktop.
