For a period of time, GSA has locked down, very frustrating processes for creating a new Google Group.  Gray reports seeing it work in about 36 hours, start to finish. 

* Open a web browser and navigate to [GSA Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com).

* Click "Service Catalog", under "Self-Service Menu" in the left sidebar.

* Service catalog auto-populates your name in the request for field. Note: If making a request on behalf of someone else, search for their name using the magnifying glass icon.

* In the step two section, there's a section called "Google Groups/Sites." Select "Google Groups/Sites Creation or Access Request."

* Complete all the necessary fields on the resulting page. Note that the business justification can be brief. _Note: If prompted to specify a supervisor, be sure to list Ric (richard.L.miller) as your supervisor for this request. He can respond quickly.

* Supply any additional pertinent information into the additional comments section.

* Click the "Order Now" button.

Note: If there's an emergency, Gray Brooks has a small backup supply of extra groups that can be repurposed.
