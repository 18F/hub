## Configure BookIT! to save yourself time in the future

[BookIT!](https://bookit.gsa.gov) allows you to reserve a meeting room in any GSA building ahead of time.

If you are having login issues, try bookmarking [this address](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp). It should immediately ask for your ENT password.

## Set your default region and office building
* This will make it so that BookIT! remembers your basic preferences, and you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room.

## Add delegates
* Add people from your team and a couple other people from ops as your delegates in BookIT!
  * This allows other people to book or check in for you in emergencies.
  * Follow these steps: `Profile -> View Your Profile -> Delegates -> Edit Profile`.
