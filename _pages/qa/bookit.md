# {{ page.title }}

We use [BookIT!](http://bookit.gsa.gov/) to reserve a desk or meeting room in GSA buildings.

## How to Use BookIt



## Set your default region and office building

* BookIT! can remember your office location, and you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room.

## Troubleshooting BookIT!

If you are having login issues, try bookmarking [the BookIT! login page ](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp). It should immediately ask for your ENT password.


## If I'm still having trouble, can someone else within my organization book rooms for me?

Yes, BookIT! allows you to add people as your delegates in BookIT!
  * This allows other people to book or check in for you in emergencies.
  * Follow these steps: `Profile -> View Your Profile -> Delegates -> Edit Profile`.
