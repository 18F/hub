## Change or reset your GSA ENT password from outside the GSA network

* Go to (https://secureauth.gsa.gov)[https://secureauth.gsa.gov]. It says you can only use Internet Explorer, but Safari and Firefox work just fine. Chrome works for many people.
* Navigate to the bottom left, “GSA AD Password Reset.” If you don’t see a link worded like this, you’re not using the right browser.
* The only restriction is 15+ characters (no special, no upper/lower case, etc. required).
* You can't reuse any of your last 10 passwords.
* Note: Upon success, it will tell you you’ve changed your “SecureAuth/Active Directory” password. This is equivalent to the “ENT” password.
* _P.S. Delete and then re-join the `gsa-wireless` network on your laptop right after you have changed your password, or else your laptop will try to connect with your old one and trigger an ENT account lock. Even if you're not in a GSA office at the time, you don't want to start your next trip to 18F HQ with a call to IT._
