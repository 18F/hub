## Change or reset your GSA ENT password from outside the GSA network

* Go to https://secureauth.gsa.gov. It says you can only use Internet Explorer, but Safari and Firefox work just fine. Chrome works for many people. 
* Navigate to the bottom left, “GSA AD Password Reset.” If you don’t see a link worded like this, you’re not using the right browser.
* The only restriction is 15+ characters (no special, no upper/lower case, etc. required).
* You can't reuse any of your last 10 passwords.
* Note: Upon success, it will tell you you’ve changed your “SecureAuth/Active Directory” password. This is equivalent to the “ENT” password.
