## What features are enabled and disabled

If you’re familiar with  Google apps you're aware that many features have been disabled or restricted for use by GSA. Fortunately, many great features are available that you might not be aware of. Here’s a quick overview:

**Gmail**

* Messages will be filtered through Postini which must be reviewed at [mrec.gsa.gov](http://mrec.gsa.gov/).

* Since you can't set a profile picture in Google profile (Google+), you just need to do it in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).

**Groups**

* You can no longer create your own groups directly; you have to [request them](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/654350).

* You can't access public google groups via the Google Groups website, but group owners can directly add your address to send and receive public group emails.

* People outside GSA can't access GSA google groups via the Google Groups website, but email still works - note the permissions for the Google group though. 

* Messages will be filtered through Postini unless you request to have it disabled.

**Calendar**

* You can't share calendars with anyone outside GSA. You can share individual invites, just not whole calendars. 

**Docs**

* You can't share docs with the public, only GSA or specific users, even just to view.

* You can't publish docs to the web.

* Docs that contain sensitive information will be blocked from sharing via Cloudlock (as of August 22, 2014).

**Drive**

* It appears that offline syncing for Google Drive/Docs has been disabled for GSA. This is consistent with the GSA firewall entirely blocking access to Dropbox. 

**Google Hangouts and Google Voice**

* Google Hangouts and Google Voice mostly work, but Google+ has been disabled, which impacts these services to some extent. Note that Google is in the process of merging Google Voice into Google Hangouts. 

* You can make and receive free domestic phone calls from within Gmail or Google Hangouts. Just create a new number with your GSA account at google.com/voice

* You can also use Google Hangouts to do conference calling, video conferences, screensharing, and bridge to a telephone line (free domestically).

* You can create Hangouts rooms from Google Calendar or by just adding them to a URL, for example, [https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/roomname](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/roomname).

* You can’t do Google Hangouts On Air with your GSA account since On Air currently requires Google+ which is disabled for GSA. 

**Google+**

* Google+ is disabled, but many features — including Google Hangouts — are now decoupled from Google+ and are generally accessible.

**Sites**

* Like Google Groups, you need to [submit a request](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/654350) to create a new Google Site.
