An official 18F policy on attending conferences, workshops and other in-person training events is located [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VcWDZbXw7lNAHj_OJbRMZBacEgO2IKJZSsTqy33gOY/edit#heading=h.hmzkrq8b1z05).

In the meantime, it's possible to go to off-site  training-related events if:

1. You're able to get yourself to the location.
2. The event qualifies as "professional development training" per the [GSA Workforce Learning and Development Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/643602).

Until the policy is officially in place, the best thing to do is talk to your supervisor if there's something you'd like to attend. If your supervisor is on board, these are the next steps. If you have any questions, e-mail Pia Scott at <pia.scott@gsa.gov>.

1. Make sure that the training is part of your [Individual Development Plan (IDP)](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/615382).
2. Submit a request in the [18F Speaking Requests/Attending Events doc](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=840687914). Be sure to put it in the tab titled TRAINING, not the first/default tab for speaking engagements.
3. If the training has associated costs, submit an [SF-182 (Authorization, Agreement, and Certification of Training)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/117002).
4. If the training is part of a conference, get [Salesforce](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-bSXujqt5mZdU9pS1dRc2ZQUXc&authuser=0) approval.
5. If travel is required, get a travel authorization. See the [Hub's travel page](../travel/) for more information.
