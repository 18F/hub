Want to increase your workplace savvy by taking a class or attending a training? Good news! As an 18F team member, you’re eligible for tuition reimbursement through GSA. The process can take a couple weeks, but it’s relatively painless— it just involves a few rounds of paperwork and supervisory approval.

The [official training policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VcWDZbXw7lNAHj_OJbRMZBacEgO2IKJZSsTqy33gOY/edit#heading=h.hmzkrq8b1z05) can be a little overwhelming. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:


### Step one
Open the [Speaking requests, attending events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=2072167708) spreadsheet. Enter the class or training you’d like to attend in the second tab— ”Training Requests.”


### Step two
Complete an [individual development plan (IDP)](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/656782). Enter the class or training as a goal.  If you need inspiration, you can find lots of sample IDPs floating around the Internet. You can also check out [this sample](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1Sid8vVFgR69gYOin5FUxbVbuC6XGEu-zIii9dO7xBN4VrWumKvl02Zs0NFKxg_bUGikkSiakn0HBFdlP/view) or [this sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDVXKHnj9lVWiloBShZ9tuU3Wwe7ErTUL0hVDncKau4/edit) to see how previous 18F team members have completed theirs. 

 Submit your IDP for approval. The approving supervisor is the same person who approves your leave requests.


### Step three
Enter your training in the event tracker on [Salesforce](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/646482). Submit it for approval. Aaron Snow is the supervisor, and Phaedra Chrousos is the HSSO.


### Step four
When your IDP is approved, you’ll get an email asking you to complete an [SF-182](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B9DenuU408s4ZDRHVWNMSEI2WlE/view). Follow the link in that email to submit it for approval.

If travel is required, add a travel expense request to the SF-182. If you're traveling, you'll also need to get [travel authorization](../travel/) once the SF-182 is approved.


### Step five
Go forth! Learn! Enjoy! Consider hosting a brown bag to share what you learn.
