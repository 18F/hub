The [official training policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18VcWDZbXw7lNAHj_OJbRMZBacEgO2IKJZSsTqy33gOY/edit#heading=h.hmzkrq8b1z05) can be a little confusing. As an employee looking to get training approved, here is what you really need to do.  If you have any questions, please reach out to the 18F Talent team.


### Step One: Identify training as part of your professional development - IDP

1. Meet with your supervisor to discuss your training needs.
2. Add (or confirm) that the training event is a part of your [Individual Development Plan (IDP)](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/533326). If not, add it.

To update your IDP, visit the [IDP tool](https://gsa--c.na1.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_ViewPage?sfdc.tabName=01r30000001L8lz).  This will open your personal IDP template.  Follow instructions to complete your IDP.


### Step Two: Submit for higher approval

Enter complete training request into [18F Speaking Requests / Attending Events spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=2072167708) -- except Columns B (Aaron/Hillary Approval), C (Red Flag) and O (Other Red Flags); P (Steps to Approval if Red Flags) and Q (Steps to Approval).

### Step Three: Review & Resolve Red Flags

After submission to the [18F Speaking Requests / Attending Events spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=2072167708) the requestor reviews and resolves Red Flags identified in the spreadsheet.

Example: "IDP and SF-182 Approval Pending.  Salesforce approval required for travel and conference attendance."


### Step Four: Complete SF-182 "Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training"

1. Create [SF-182](https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a2r/o).

2. If travel, then add travel expense request to SF-182.

3. Submit to your Supervisor for signature.

### Step Five: Get Travel Authorization and book travel!

Once the SF-182 is approved, if travel is required, get a travel authorization. See the [Hub's travel page](../travel/) for more information.

*Receipts -- keep those and scan for voucher submission!*

### Step Six: Attend the training!

### Step Seven: Share what you learned

If you attend a training, when you return you should schedule a brown bag about what you learned so others can benefit from your experiences.
