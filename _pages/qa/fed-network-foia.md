## When connected to a federal network is the data being sent over the connection FOIA-able (inclusive of personal email or non-work related websites)?

Maybe. The public could FOIA that information, but the vast majority of it (if not the entire request) would be rejected. In other words, since the Government tracks and stores all data going in and out of Federal networks, this "record" is within the scope of FOIA, but we would likely rule it as falling under multiple [FOIA exemptions](http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exemptions).

Is your communication over personal email private? In almost every case, yes. Is it private if you're conducting official Government work over it? No.

Also note that we're capturing your data *on the wire* and not on your client (the personal computer). Have we mentioned lately how [important HTTPS (SSL/TLS)](https://github.com/18F/ssl-standards) is, even for the sake of government employees' privacy? ;)
