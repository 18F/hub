## Get help from the 18F Delivery team

While some projects may be too small, too big, or just don't [line up with our strategy](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/), 18F Delivery will always have a conversation with you about helping.

In general, if your partner agency isn't willing to support at least one 18F Delivery team member for about six months (roughly equal to a $100,000 investment), it's unlikely we'd get involved or start scoping out what needs to be done. At the same time, we might already have a solution in place and can provide access to it at little or no cost.

Write up a few sentences explaining the proposal, and send it to [aaron.snow@gsa.gov](mailto:aaron.snow@gsa.gov), cc [noah.kunin@gsa.gov](mailto:noah.kunin@gsa.gov).
