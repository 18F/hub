* The GSA guest password changes monthly and is available at [http://insite.gsa.gov](http://insite.gsa.gov).
    * We also try to keep it up-to-date in Slack. You just need to type `guest wifi` in any channel.
* SSID: gsa-wireless (not visible, you must enter it manually) + WPA2 Enterprise + your ENT credentials.
* You may need to use ENT\username instead of just username when logging in to the wireless on Linux.
