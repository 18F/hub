## Request leave (sick, annual, or vacation time)

* Visit [http://aloha.gsa.gov/](http://aloha.gsa.gov/). Use your GSA credentials to log in.

* Submit supervisor approval to Aaron Snow.

* See your remaining leave balances by clicking "Create My Leave Request." Note that you don't actually have to submit.

* The best practice is to ask for leave ahead of time. However, you can request leave retroactively, if necessary.

* Don't go through ALOHA for Jury Duty. Instead, send a message to Leah Gitter with the date(s) you'll be out and add yourself to the calendar as described below. Also, you'll still get paid. 

* **When you know you’re taking time off, please also add an event on the Google calendar "18F Out of Office" and invite yourself, so we all know when you’re gone.**
