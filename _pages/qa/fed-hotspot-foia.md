## When connected to a Government owned mobile hotspot (either a stand-alone device or a cell phone), is any data being sent over the connection FOIA-able (inclusive of personal email or non-work related websites)?

It depends. If you use that connection to create a VPN connection back onto a federal network, yes. But that FOIA request would likely be rejected due to [FOIA exemptions](http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exemptions).
