In general, 18Fâ€™s point-of-contact (POC) at the GSA Office of General Counsel (OGC) is John Peters, [john.h.peters@gsa.gov](mailto:john.h.peters@gsa.gov).

For ethics questions, you can contact John directly. If you get guidance that you think other 18F team members may benefit from, please share it!

John adds: *"If I am out of the office for any reason and you need an answer to an ethics question/issue ASAP, you may also contact Ken Sharrett directly at [kenneth.sharrett@gsa.go*v](mailto:kenneth.sharrett@gsa.gov)."*

For project-related legal matters, contact [Aaron Snow](mailto:aaron.snow@gsa.gov) and John as necessary.

For event- and speaking-related legal/ethics questions, contact [Pia Scott](mailto:pia.scott@gsa.gov) first.
