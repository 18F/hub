## What software is approved for standard use at GSA?

A list is available on the software request form. Navigate to the IT Service Desk. Find the link for "Software Requests" under "Common Requests." Click that, then click "Software" on the next page. You're now at the "Software Request Form." Notice a drop-down under "Select Approved Software." That is the list of approved software.
