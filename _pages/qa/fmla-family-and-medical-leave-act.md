The Family and Medical Leave Act allows most federal employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per 12-month period for the birth/care of a child, an adoption or placement of child for Foster Care, the care of a spouse/son/daughter/parent with serious health condition, a serious health condition of an employee, or a qualifying exigency from spouse/son/daughter/parent of an employee on covered active duty in the Armed Forces.

The Department of Labor has a [detailed guide](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/) to FMLA, including this [FAQ](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/fmla-faqs.htm) which goes into extensive detail.
