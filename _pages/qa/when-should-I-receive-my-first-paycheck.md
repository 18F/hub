You receive your first paycheck approximately three weeks after your start date. This is because every 18F employee starts work at the beginning of a pay period. It takes a week after the end of a pay period for a direct deposit to be made.

You can look at the [GSA Payroll Calendar](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102507) to see future pay cycles.
