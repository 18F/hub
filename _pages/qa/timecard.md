During the onboarding process, you should have been added to [Tock](https://tock.18f.gov/), 18F's weekly time tracking system, and given a quick tutorial.  If not, let #teamops know and they can add you.  All 18F team members are required to report their time spent on the various billable and non-billable projects.

If the "Reporting Periods You Need to Fill Out" section has a long list of time periods that predate you joining 18F, you can fix this easily. Click on the "Users" link, and then find your name in the list of Tock users. Your email address should be a clickable link. After clicking that link, you'll be redirected to a page where you can enter an "Employment Start Date," which should be the day you started at 18F. Click the "Update" button. Now that long list of reports to fill out should be gone.
