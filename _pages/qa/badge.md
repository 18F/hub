* When you receive an email from [HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov](mailto:HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov) that your badge is ready (subject: USAccess - Credential Ready for Pick Up), it might seem like the instructions are step-by-step because they're numbered. You should not follow them in order; they want you to do step four (create an appointment) before steps one, two, and three.
