Badges allow you to get in and out GSA buildings and avoid the long security lines. To check on the status of your GSA badge, you can send an email to accesscard@gsa.gov. New badges are processed every Wednesday by GSA.

When your badge is ready, you will receive an email (in both your personal and GSA emails) from HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov. The email contains four steps: you want to skip to step four, which details how to schedule an appointment and pick up your badge, and make sure to bring the password mentioned in step three. 

**Distributed Employees: Badges are shipped to your local GSA office. You will receive an email once your badge has been shipped. At that point, you can make an appointment to pick up your badge. Your badge may be available during your orientation â€” send an email to accesscard@gsa.gov  to save yourself a trip. You may also ask your orientation leader to show you where to pick up your badge.**
