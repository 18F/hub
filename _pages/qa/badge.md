Badges allow you to get in and out GSA buildings and avoid the long security lines. To check on the status of your GSA badge, you can send an email to accesscard@gsa.gov. New badges are processed every Wednesday by GSA.

When your badge is ready, you will receive an email from HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov. At that point, you can schedule an appointment and pick up your badge. 

**Distributed Employees: Badges are shipped to your local GSA office. You will receive an email once your badge has been shipped. At that point, you can make an appointment to pick up your badge.**
