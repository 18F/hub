## To Refer Someone:

1. [Add Names to This Form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/11CQPh9lvLSb-S-6O0JfCsje4Me805X_NQpeZPivcFis/viewform?c=0&w=1)
2. Please be sure to include any information you have on the candidate including contact information, current employer, current location, primary and secondary skill set, and any additional information you may have in the notes section. 
3. If possible, send them a short message indicating that you have put their name on our list. 

## To Help With Phone Screens:
We need people to do phone screen referrals (20-30 min ea) so that we can keep our interview pipeline full. Basically, your role will be to decide if the candidate warrants a full, 4 hour long interview with the team. *Obviously do not phone screen a candidate that you personally referred.

1. Review [This draft hiring doc](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1nRFm7kphV18d-eOa74FjUwJ6C3oie8Dl0DpKV7bM5tA/edit); the Phone Interview section specifically. 
2. When you're ready to schedule interviews, visit the referral doc ~~(spreadsheet above)~~, go to the "INPUT_MASTER" tab, and choose a recruit tagged with "NeedsAction" (column A).
3. Scroll to the right and enter your name into the cell in column M.
4. After you've conducted the phone screen, please note the date in column N, and provide any important information that we may not have such as: current location, willingness to relocate, more information on their skills, links to resume or portfolio, etc.
5. Send an email to Jamie and Ric, letting them know if they should start the team interview process. If they shouldn't proceed with the full team interviews, please just send them an email with a short explanation. 

Note: 
Hillary, Aaron, Noah, Joe, and John Yuda (in a past life) have all done this type of screening before (as probably many of us have), so please feel free to reach out to them for their thoughts on how to conduct these calls.
