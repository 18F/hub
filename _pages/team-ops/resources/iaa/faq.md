## Q: What is an Interagency Agreement?

An Interagency Agreement (IAA) allows us to provide services to your agency.
Essentially, it's a more formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), composed
of standard terms, two Treasury forms, and a specific set of legal authorities.<sup>1</sup>
We move our clients through the IAA process as quickly and painlessly as we can,
and we're available to help every step of the way.

<sup>1</sup>Generally, 18F executes IAAs under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535.

## Q: Who are the parties to an IAA?

The two parties are formally known as the requesting agency (that's you!)
and the servicing agency (us).

## Q: What are the required components?

We use two, Treasury-recommended forms:

- The [7600A, for general terms and conditions](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/forms/IAA-general-terms-condition-ver6-09-23-11.pdf)
- The [7600B, for the order requirements and funding information](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/forms/IAA-Order-7600B-10-10-12-update.pdf).

The general terms broadly outline the nature and scope of engagement between our agencies.
Completing this form *doesn't* bind or obligate either party to perform or pay.

The order requirements hash out a project's specifics. Think of it as a task order
or work order submitted to a vendor: it spells out the statement of work,
project cost, and performance period.

There's only ever one set of general terms, but you can issue multiple order requirements
for different projects or performance periods.


## Q: What if I have questions about the forms?

Our staff will help you complete all parts of the the forms, including filling in necessary boxes.

If you're interested in more general information, read [the information about
the standard forms and instructions published on the Department of the
Treasury website](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/iaa_forms.htm).

## Q: What’s the difference between an "agreement period" and a "period of performance?"

An agreement period is set in the general terms. Depending on the
nature of the engagement, this may be multiple years.

The performance period is set in the order requirements. It's
specific to a particular project and obligates both parties:
During that time period, we're required to perform our tasks,
and you're required to pay the actual costs we incur.

Find more information from Treasury's [Fiscal Management Service website](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/iaa_forms.htm).

## Q: Does an IAA encumber or obligate any funds?

Yes, but only when your agency issues its first order requirements.
At that point, your agency’s finance office will obligate the amount of funds
indicated on the 7600B. As we invoice for services or products delivered,
those obligated funds are transferred as payment.

Of course, if the project comes in under budget, your finance office can
deobligate any unused funds and use them for other purposes. Additionally,
we comply with federal law that requires full cost recovery, and
the cost may increase if the project costs are more than our original
estimate.

## Q: Does my contracting officer need to approve an IAA?

It depends. Every agency has different policies on who can sign the IAA. You should
check with your office of the chief financial officer to find out who
can sign these documents.

Generally, approval requires a program official with designated authority to
sign the agreement as well as a representative of the chief financial officer
with the authority to sign the agreement and obligate the funds.

Find more information on Treasury's [Fiscal Management Service website](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/iaa_forms.htm).

## Q: What is a determination and findings?

A determination and findings statement we enter into the IAA
under the authority of the Economy Act, which is common. This statement
needs to include all three of these provisions:

1. The IAA is in the best interest of the government.
1. The product or services cannot be obtained conveniently or
economically by contracting with a private source.
1. 18F has the capability or expertise to provide services not
available within your agency.

## Q: Where is the scope and/or statement of work?

The statement of work is found in "Attachment A" to Form
7600B.

## Q: What information should I gather to complete an IAA?

The key component of an IAA is agreement between our agencies on the statement of work.
This is the “meat” of our agreement. It spells out the reason you're engaging us
and what we'll deliver. At the start of the IAA process, we'll draft a proposed
statement of work and share it with you for comment.

Once we both agree on the statement of work, you should gather
the following pieces of administrative information:

* **Name of requesting office**: The full office name and postal
  address of the specific office requesting the services.

* **Name of program official**: The full name, title, and email address of the person in your agency with the
  authority to sign the IAA.

* **Name of funding official**: The full name, title, and email address of the
  person in your agency with authority to obligate the funds needed for the IAA.

* **Type of money**: This is a description of the funds being used. For example, "one-year,"
  "multi-year," or "no-year."

* **Financial codes**: ALC, TAS, BETC, and BPN from your finance office.

We'll send you the [IAA Form Preparation Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1yuZ5ITewyEo1CPqxmoKLGj_BhX9GTDI6UF2sQSQbvBk/viewform)
to collect this information and populate the IAA forms maker. You can
view the information required on the survey using the [IAA Form Preparation
PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwzPQaT19ZdoSTJiUTBWQzJHY1U&authuser=0).

## Q: How long should I expect the IAA process to take?

We view the IAA process as a means to an end, and the end is the successful
delivery of products and services to our clients. That said, our work can't commence
without an IAA in place. Typically, this takes about **four weeks**
from the date a client and 18F decide to work together. A large chunk
of that time is spent finalizing the statement of work.

Throughout the process, we're willing and available to resolve any questions or concerns you might have.
