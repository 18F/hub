## Washington, DC headquarters

### Rooms 

If smaller than 25-30, there are several accessible and well laid out rooms at 1147, 1149, 1151, and 1153.  1153 is notable for being a double sized conference room, possibly the largest room in the building that is reservable via BookIt.  If booking far enough in advance, it may be possible to book 2-3 of these rooms at the same time to allow break-out groups.  

For large events, the main rooms to choose from are 1459, 1460, and 1461.  These are very large and have plenty of options for layout and functionality.  They can also be combined in to 2x and 3x size rooms, [with a range of configurations affecting capacity](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvBrYqdsWSajdEkwemNQU2wyQ2ZkRG9XaGs4emZ5dEE&usp=sharing#gid=0).  Unfortunately, they also are often reserved well in advance.  

To request one or more of these rooms, begin by reserving them in bookit.  You should hear back from `tiara.barnes@gsa.gov` within a day or two with followup.  If not reach out to her and `1800freservations@gsa.gov`.  You'll be asked to then submit a filled out version of [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvBrYqdsWSajdEkwemNQU2wyQ2ZkRG9XaGs4emZ5dEE&usp=sharing#gid=0).  It is also wise to include what flexibility you have about day/time.    

A map and directions to these rooms is [available here](http://gsa.github.io/Open-Data-Collaboration-Sandbox/gsa_confererence_center_map).  

There is also a very large auditorium (capacity 300) though it is less condusive for interactive events.

### Non-Government Attendees

Just a reminder that for your meetings that you have set up, for any Non-Government employees you'll have to email Alton.Bigelow@gsa.gov, Stevie.Boose@gsa.gov and darlene.shelton@gsa.gov a list of everyone attending. Inlcuding:

1. Alphabetical Listing of Visitor’s Name
2. Agency/Company Name
3. Point of Contact Name, Room Number and Phone Number

For meetings with 15 or more attendees, it is recommended that they be asked to arrive at least 45 minutes early to avoid long lines and delays in the lobby area and to be able to report to the meeting on time.

### Support 

Pia Scott can provide support to organize and coordinate logistics for events we host.  

### After Hours Events 

> "I received notification from Building Management that events after 6:30 p.m. require two guards.  There is a four-hour minimum.  The cost is $59 per hour ($236).  The required payment method is the Charge Card.  

> The request for guard service must be submitted at least two weeks in advance.  If the events ends at 6:30 p.m., additional guard service is not required."

> If the event begins before 5 p.m. then additional security will not be required.  We will need a security sponsor, who will be responsible for non-federal visitors entering the building.  We will need to provide security with at least two federal employees to sign-in the visitors.

> Security is requesting that visitors enter through the E Street entrance (back of building).  Visitors must have a valid government-issued ID (Government ID or Driver's License) to obtain access to the building (no exceptions will be allowed).  Screenings are required for non-federal visitors.  Visitor should arrive 30-45 minutes before the event. 

> The event must begin before 5 p.m. to be exempt from the additional security.
> Late arrivals will not be admitted after 6 p.m., or additional security will be required.
