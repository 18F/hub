# {{ page.title }}

## Goals
* Invite interesting and insightful figures from outside government to speak at GSA. These should be substantive enough that many 18F staff would want to attend.  
* Invite govies from other agencies to join.  
* There should be a blogpost after the event.  
* Brand the entire experience **18F Speaker Series**

## Guiding Principles
* 18F staff are need to propose and facilitate the speakers.  
* The events working group will maintain a recipe that can be followed.  Pia can help with logistics.  
* There's no set schedule for the series and no specific need to 'gin up' more presenters.  
* The presentations should be on digital issues and not of a commercial nature.  

## Other Possibilities
* Record and post the video online 

## Questions 
* Right name? 
* Is there any ability to pay for travel? 
* I'm assuming events are intended only for government staff and contractors.  

## Recipe
1. Decide on a presenter.  
2. Vet any ethics considerations with X, Y, Z, mainly by filling out a [copy of this form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1AaFXcBqkHtvmMGKyiZqvWqKzFAI3tqwHcFDpgAjDwvs/edit).   
3. Coordinate a potential speaking date by engaging with the speaker, confirming an appropriately sized room, and checking for potential 18F conflicts.  
4. Prepare a invitation and signup form.  
5. Circulate the invitation in appropriate forums* 2+ weeks in advance, as well as closer to the date.  
6. Ensure the room and AV needs.  
7. Coordinate visitor access with Security.  
8. Coordinate the speaker's arrival and management day of.  
9. Afterwards, write up a brief blog post with photos, use a consistent tag and brand the event as part of the series.  
## OGC Reminders 

* Be sure to avoid the session turning in to a sales pitch or a discussion on what [X service] can do for federal agencies.  
* We also have to make sure we are not giving [X service] preferential treatment, so you have to be willing to provide the same access to similarly situated companies.
