# {{ page.title }}

## Leave
Employees must report to work or have leave approved every scheduled work day.
All requests for leave should be submitted in ALOHA to the administrative supervisor or
designee. Do this at least three business days in advance.

Your administrative supervisor will be the person listed as your supervisor in our organizational charts. If
your administrative supervisor is out (say on vacation) they can designate
leave approval authority to another person.

In the case of emergency or illness, you can ask for permission for absence from your administrative supervisor (or designee) no later than two hours before the start of your typical work day, in your typical time zone. 

Requests for annual or sick leave must be made on each day of absence, unless otherwise arranged.
Failure to do so can result in the denial of leave, which can lead to a charge of absence without leave
(AWOL).  AWOL is an unauthorized or un-approved absence from duty, and can be the basis for disciplinary action. 

## Telework
Telework provides valuable flexibility to employees. It increases morale, productivity, and collaboration among peers.
The 18F office recognizes these benefits and encourages the use of telework within the parameters described below. This policy adheres to and is in conjunction with GSA's Mobility and Telework Policy.
Employees can telework with the approval of their administrative supervisor or his/her designee.  

### Maximum number of days
You can telework up to six days per two-week pay period.This is maximum telework allowed in adherence to
the intent of the Mobility and Telework Policy. Infrequently, you may telework additional days on a case-by-case basis and with supervisory approval.

TeamOps](../telework-policy-supplement-for-team-ops)

### Culture
While your administrative supervisor officially approves telework days, 
our office culture calls on employees to keep their project teams and duty-station 
co-workers apprised of telework days. Accomplish this through any of our designated communication channels.

### Alternative worksite location
As an employee, it's your responsibility to ensure alternative worksites
provide the work environment, connectivity, technology, resource
access, and security consistent with the work you're doing. In other words, 
you need to be aware of security, internet access, and similar concerns. 
This is explained further in the "Connectivity" section below.

You must be available to the team as if you were "in the office." 

Supervisors can overrule any employee-selected alternative
worksite location if they feel it isn't business appropriate or fails to 
provide a working environment compliant with the conditions outlined in GSA’s Mobility and Telework Policy.

Without prior approval, you may not work outside your local commuting area. 

### "Local commuting areas" explained
"Local communting areas" are totally subjective and not defined either in law or in GSA
policy, even though the subjective definition is [set in
code](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/351.203). Ultimately, it's up to
a supervisor to define the local commuting area for a particular team.

"Outside the local commuting area" does apply to employees working from other GSA offices. For example, an employee stationed in San Francisco who flies to Chicago to work in the GSA Chicago office is "outside the local commuting area" and must obtain prior, supervisory approval. 

### Working at another office
As outlined above, you can work in an office other than your official duty location, with prior approval. This is called  "alternative officing" and isn't considered teleworking. 

### Connectivity
As a teleworker, it's your responsibility to ensure your alternative worksite has
voice and computer connectivity capability.  If you experience a
power outage or interruption in internet access, you can work on tasks that don't
require connectivity; do this in consultation with your supervisor. 
Alternatively, you can report to your official worksite or take leave.

If your telework status or telework schedule change, let your administrative supervisor 
know immediately. For example, "Working from home today, but I'll
be in the office tomorrow!"

### Schedule
If you're required to report to an official worksite on a scheduled telework day, you'll
usually be given at least one business day of notice. If that isn't possible, your
administrative supervisor or designee will notify you as soon as possible. For example,
telework schedules may need adjustment for business needs, like mandatory meetings
or office coverage. 

You need to follow leave procedures on telework days. For example,
if you have a doctor's appointment during work hours, request and obtain approval
for that leave time. 

In the event of inclement weather or other disruption, OPM or another authorized organization may
announce "Unscheduled Telework" (posted on www.opm.gov). 
On those days, you can take advantage of unscheduled telework if you have a computer 
available to conduct your work as well as sufficient
work to fill the "Unscheduled Telework" hours.  If you don't have
a government-issued computer on hand, you can use 
a personal computer. You should notify your administrative supervisor of your 
intention to telework before the scheduled start of the work day.

### Security
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other secure information, including
information protected by the Privacy Act, must be maintained in accordance with
the GSA Rules of Behavior for Handling Personally Identifiable Information,
Order HCO 2180.1, paragraph 7.

Teleworkers must successfully complete the following required GSA On-Line
University courses before beginning (or in order to
continue) teleworking: "Telework Works" and "Annual Privacy Training 101 and IT Security
Awareness."  In addition, within 90 days of beginning
telework, teleworkers must also take and successfully complete the
following On-Line University courses, as appropriate:

> Telework Works for employees; or (2) Managing Distributed Teams for managers.
>
> Sensitive material, including information protected by the Privacy Act, must
> be viewed only on government issued equipment or via Citrix.  No information
> may be stored or saved to non-government issued equipment.
>
> Family members and friends of the teleworker are not authorized to use the
> government issued equipment.
>
> It is the employees’ responsibility to ensure that they have all of the
> necessary files at their telework worksite and that they are complying with
> GSA policies regarding the handling and securing of GSA Records and Files and
> Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
>
> (1) Employees may physically transport GSA files to their telework worksite
> prior to teleworking. It is the employee’s responsibility to safeguard and
> protect all GSA files in their possession while teleworking and while
> transporting the files to and from the telework worksite.
>
> (2) Employees may also digitally scan GSA files to create an electronic
> document, which can be used while teleworking. It is the employee’s
> responsibility to ensure that the electronic document is legible prior to
> teleworking.

### Important points
Detailed employees shall enter into telework agreements with their detailed
supervisors.

Telework is not a substitute for dependent care, e.g., child care or elder
care.

Telework is not a substitute for sick leave.

You're bound by the Standards of Ethical Conduct while
working at an alternative worksite and using government equipment.

Teleworking is a privilege and not an entitlement.

## Virtual worker agreements
18F makes use of virtual worker agreements when
employees live outside official duty stations. For example, we have employees in Portland, Atlanta, and Dayton but no established 18F office location. Once a geographic area has enough employees to warrant an official office, one is established. For example, San Francisco and New York City are now official office locations. When an official office is established, all virtual workers in that location become teleworkers.
