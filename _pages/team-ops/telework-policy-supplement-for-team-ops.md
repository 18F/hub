# {{ page.title }}

In adhering to the intent of the GSA Mobility and Telework Policy, and broader
18F telework policy, 18F TeamOps employees may be allowed up to four (4)
telework days per pay period, i.e. two (2) days per week. Days may not be
taken in succession (eg Friday and following Monday). This will permit a
reasonable degree of telework while retaining an in-office physical presence
in order to justify assigned office space and ensure productivity through team
cohesion and in-person collaboration.

A regular teleworker may be permitted to telework episodically for additional,
or successive, days on a case-by-case basis and with the approval of his/her
administrative supervisor. Request for approvals shall be submitted, and
approved, no less than 3 business days prior to the start of requested
additional or successive day(s). Such approvals shall be infrequent.

This policy is effective May 3rd, 2015.
