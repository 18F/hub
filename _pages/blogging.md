title: How to write a blog post for 18F
---
# {{ page.title }}

First, it might be a good idea to check out our [mission brief]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog-mission/), if you haven't already. 
At 18F we keep a [private GitHub repo](https://github.com/18f/blog-drafts) for kicking around ideas on the blog. This is how we use that repo. (Note to people not at the GSA or on the 18F team: Many of the links on this page will likely _not_ work for you.)

We use milestones for workflow tracking:

1. `idea`
1. `draft`
1. `to edit`
1. `ready to approve`
1. `approved`

For new posts:

1. Create an issue in the blog-drafts repo and set the milestone to `ideas`. In that issue, please include the following headings:
    * `## Audience`
    * `## Goal of blog post`
    * `## Imagery ideas`
    * `## Description` â€“ This is what people will see in the blog post list. If you'd like to create a separate description, insert it here; otherwise, we'll likely use the first couple of sentences of the post.
    * `## Who needs to clear the post` as a checklist. The following names are required for all posts:
        * [ ] @OriHoffer (From GSA's Office of Communications and Marketing)
        * [ ] Gia (From GSA's Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs)
        * [ ] Teressa (From GSA's Office of Communications and Marketing)
        * [ ] @NoahKunin

Also include anybody inside or outside of our team who should have eyes on it:

        * [ ] partner at agency
        * [ ] stakeholder
        * [ ] 18F project team

**Blog posts without this information will be marked with the`incomplete` label until they are fully filled in. We will not publish "incomplete" posts.**

If you are unsure of what to put in any section, drop in on a blog huddle or hit us up on Slack (#blog).

1. Any team member can "pick up" issues and begin drafting a post. If you pick up an issue, assign yourself as the owner.
    * Once an issue is in writing mode, move it to the `drafts` milestone.
1. To draft a post, create a Google Doc in [the Blog folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/#folders/0B-y3CqI2T1nndGE0c191NGtUTEU) with the text of your post.
    * Include the URL of the GitHub issue at the top.
    * You draft should also include a headline, authors, and [suggested tags](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/wiki/Tagging-on-the-Blog).
    * Paste a link to the doc in the issue.
1. Once the post is ready for comms approval:
    * Assign the issue to **@quepol** (Hillary).
    * Move it to the `to edit` milestone.
    * A member of the comms team will edit the post and work with you to resolve any issues.
1. If any outside agency needs to review the post, the draft should be sent to them after it has been cleared by the comms team.
1. When a post has been cleared by the comms team and any outside reviewers, a comms team member will move it to the `ready to approve` milestone, write a comment on the issue tagging @quepol, @aaronsnow, @noahkunin, and @orihoffer, and tag Ori and Noah in the Google Doc draft for approval. Ori will then run the post by Gia and Teressa. Noah, Ori, Teressa, and Gia need to actively approve the post for it to be published.
1. After comments and suggestions are received and resolved from them, move the issue to the `approved` milestone.
1. Write a new comment and `/cc @gboone @awfrancisco`, who will:
    1. Convert the post to markdown.
    1. Post it to staging for final review. Any final edits will be discussed in #blog.
    1. Post it to production
1. Once the post goes live, post the final URL and the description in a comment and **close** the issue.

## Posts about external projects

If your post is announcing an 18F project that collaborates with an outside agency, or if you are providing an update or more information on an existing 18F project, you must complete a Comms Plan. This is a document to be given to the communications office, congressional affairs offices, and senior management at GSA. A communications team member will help you complete this document.
